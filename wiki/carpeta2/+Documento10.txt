This is a full list of the mammals native to the U.S. state of New York.

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature:

Opossums, order Didelphimorphia
Didelphimorphia is the order of common opossums of the Western Hemisphere. Opossums probably diverged from the basic South American marsupials in the late Cretaceous or early Paleocene. The Virginia opossum is the only marsupial/opossum species in New York.
